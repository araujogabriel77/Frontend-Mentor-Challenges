## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹


**To do this challenge, you need a basic understanding of HTML and CSS.**

## The challenge

Your task is to build out the project to the designs inside the `/design` folder. You will find both a mobile and a desktop version of the design to work to. 

The designs are in JPG static format. This will mean that you'll need to use your best judgment for styles such as `font-size`, `padding` and `margin`. This should help train your eye to perceive differences in spacings and sizes.

**Have fun building!** ðŸš€
